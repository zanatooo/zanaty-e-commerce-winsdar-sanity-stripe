Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. It’s important to feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project will be your best opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. That’s why one of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.

Project Requirements
Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on user demand. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill some specific requirements.

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 20.

You should also consider the following suggestions to help your project stand out:

CSS Styling
Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components (Links to an external site.) and Emotion (Links to an external site.).

Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI (Links to an external site.), Chakra UI (Links to an external site.), or Ant Design (Links to an external site.).

Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose— it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

Payment Platform
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce platform, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

Bonus
Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

Uses a web manifest

Uses a service worker for offline functionality

Is installable
